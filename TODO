Planned for v0.5 and beyond
===========================
	* waveform visuals (check out wave drawing in kdenlive editor)
	* automatic correction of OCR errors
	* rename "current line" to "active line"

* it's annoying to have a subtitle fail to load because of an invalid encoding
  issue, perhaps the "next" encoding should be tried and the error informed
* the player controls won't appear on fullscreen mode with KDE4.2 (disabling KWin desktop effects "fixes" the issue)
* translation service could improve syncronization issues if it cooperated more closely with the subtitle

* add KROSS scripting examples in ruby and if possible in python
* test find text/errors when adding/removing lines
