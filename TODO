Planned features / known issues

* integrate waveform visuals (delayed until audio decoding is supported by phonon)
* automatic correction of OCR errors
* failing to load a subtitle fail because of an invalid encoding issue is annoying, perhaps the "next" encoding should be tried and the error informed.
* translation service could improve synchronization issues if it cooperated more closely with the subtitle
