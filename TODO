Planned for v0.5 and beyond
===========================
	* waveform visuals (check out wave drawing in kdenlive editor)
	* automatic correction of OCR errors
	* use KDE proxy settings for internet services (i.e., text translation) -- how do we do that?

* undo/redo actions must provide some visual feedback of what's changed
* it's annoying to have a subtitle fail to load because of an invalid encoding
  issue, perhaps the "next" encoding should be tried and the error informed
* finish KROSS scripting interface
* test find text/errors when adding/removing lines
