This is a continuation of Subtitle Composer - https://sourceforge.net/projects/subcomposer/
Since original authot didn't have time anymore to continue development of this great app, I've took over in order to submit fixes and add more features in free time.

TODO:
 - code cleanup and bugfixes before releasing v1.0
 - add Speech Recognition (through PocketSphinx http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2010/03/pocketsphinx-0-6-release/) to automate original language subtitle synhronization
 - add Speech Recognition to create new subtitles in original language

Help and ideas are welcome.
