Subtitle Composer
Copyright (C) 2007-2012 Sergio Pistone

This is a fork of Subtitle Composer - https://sourceforge.net/projects/subcomposer/
After failed attempts in contacting the original project owner I've decided to make a fork here in order to submit some fixes and add some more features in free time.

First planned feature to add is Speech Recognition (through PocketSphinx http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/2010/03/pocketsphinx-0-6-release/) which would automate subtitle synchronization in english, and would help new subtitle creation.

Help and ideas are welcome.
